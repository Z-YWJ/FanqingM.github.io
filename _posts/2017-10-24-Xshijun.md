The problem of biosafety is concerned by all countries in the world, and the food poisoning and infectious diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria are the most serious. Nowadays, the application of phages in the control of microorganisms and treatment has made certain progress, especially in the food research and application gradually rise. Bacteriophages can be used to control pathogenic bacteria in food to improve food quality and safety.



Bacteriophage biocontrol is commonly used in fresh foods, cheese products, and meat products. The effects of the addition of phages are very rapid and effective, and the phages remain in the food for subsequent food processing and distribution, but are not dependent on these residues for subsequent bacterial control. Bacteriophages can also be used as bactericides on food processing equipment. At present, the phage control of putative bacteria has tended to be dominated by pseudomonas. Meanwhile, escherichia coli pathogens have received relatively little attention when it comes to phage control of agricultural products. A conference paper describes bacteriophage biocontrol of lettuce and melon. This work has used commercially available phage mixtures incubated at 4°C with some success. Many of the reports describing successful biocontrol of food use large numbers of phages. Data have shown that L. monocytogenes have a dosedependent response to the inactivation of salmon and other foods. In summary, phages show promise as biological control agents for foodborne pathogens and spoilage bacteria, especially since their modes of action are being better understood by scientific researchers.



S. aureus is a highly pathogenic pathogen, which usually causes mastitis in cows and causes extensive contamination of milk and dairy products. Among meat products, ham is also one of the main contamination carriers. Chang et al. evaluated the application effect of LysSA11 derived from phage SA11 as a biological control agent in food. When LysSA11 was added to ham samples, it had a significant bactericidal effect within 15 min, and reduced S. aureus in samples at 4 ℃ and 25 ℃, respectively. This study suggests that bacteriophage endolysotin can also be used as a food antimicrobial, which provides a new idea for protecting food safety with bacteriophages.



V. parahaemolyticus is a zoonoses causing bacteria that are common in seafood and can cause food poisoning when eating raw or undercooked seafood. Ren Hongyu et al. studied the prevention and control effect of V. parahaemolyticus by feeding sea cucumber with phage for the first time. The results showed that the survival rate of sea cucumber in the control group was less than 30%, while that in the phage treatment group was about 80%, and the survival rate was slightly higher than that in the antibiotic treatment group. The results show that phage has been successfully applied in aquatic products and is expected to be a substitute for antibiotics. However, a large number of experiments are needed to improve its operability and practicability.
