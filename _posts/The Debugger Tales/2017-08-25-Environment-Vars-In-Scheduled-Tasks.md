## **Generation And Harm of Superbugs**
Since the appearance of antibiotics, bacteria seem to have lost their brilliance on the medical stage. Whether it is a cold, fever or surgery, a small dose of antibiotics will be used, and the bacteria will surrender. However, with the passage of time, bacteria evolved, slowly developing shields resisting the sword of antibiotics. Then, bacteria become "superbugs." In recent years, superbugs have caused great harm to human health. 

## So what is "superbug"? Is it a mutant bacterium? 

In fact, superbacteria do not specifically refer to a certain kind of bacteria. The medical community defines them as "multi drug resistant bacteria", which generally refers to those bacteria that have have developed resistance to antibiotics. Superbugs are hardy, adaptable, and multiply with astonishing speed. But the scariest thing about superbugs is not the characteristics listed above, but their resistance to common bactericidal drugs, antibiotics. Patients infected with these "superbugs" are often left with no cure, and can only wait to die.

### **These are all "raised" by antibiotics.** 

Initially, superbugs were found in hospitals, where the balance between antibiotics and bacterial resistance was upset because antibiotics abuse. Bacteria which were originally resistant to only one antibiotic gradually got power to tolerate multiple antimicrobial drugs through constant wrestling and evolution. **So to speak, the superbug is actually human "feed" out.**

### **What is antibiotics abuse?** 

In a word, any overtime, excessive, inappropriate use or non-standard use of antibiotics belong to antibiotics abuse. The emergence of bacterial drug resistance is a natural law, but the large-scale occurrence and spread of this phenomenon is a human error. It must be pointed out that the biggest reason for the antibiotics abuse is the lack of understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of antibiotics!

## So how should we deal with it? Is it really hopeless?

Facing superbug, what would happen if stronger antibiotics were used? Many studies and clinical cases have found that high-intensity antibiotics have greater side effects on the human body than ordinary antibiotics, and the disadvantages of treatment outweigh the advantages. In the case of infection, patients are very prone to more serious chain reactions, such as liver and kidney failure and damage to the immune system. At this point, even a simple cold will deprive a person lives, because the body can no longer fight off bacterial infections.

In other words, it’s very difficult to kill bacteria and not kill person. So we really can't solve the superbug problem? Let's back to nature, there is **natural bacteria killer: phage**. “Traditional antibiotics are losing their edge, and phages are the new weapon in our battle against bacteria” says Benjamin K. Chan, PhD. Phagotherapy, developed based on this natural law, could be an effective way to target superbugs.

## **To resist powerful superbugs, people must first strengthen ourselves!**

 

- Rational use of antibiotics and prevention of antibiotics abuse are the most important means to prevent the prevalence of superbugs. The use of antibiotics should adhere to the "four noes" principle: do not buy drugs at will, do not choose drugs by yourself, do not take and stop drugs at will.

- Pay attention to personal hygiene, especially wash hands correctly. And you’d better strengthen physical exercise, eat reasonably, pay attention to rest and improve the body's resistance.

- Self immunity is the best weapon: because superbugs are difficult to treat, the best way to deal with it is defense. When the immunity is strong and the immune potential of the body is stimulated, the superbugs will be shielded!
