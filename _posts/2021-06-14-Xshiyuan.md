Foodborne disease is a disease caused by human ingestion of contaminated food, which may be caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites. Among them, bacteria is the main cause of foodborne diseases.



Modern rapid detection methods for foodborne pathogens include immunological methods (such as enzyme-linked immunosorption, immunodiffusion, and colloidal gold)



Technology), molecular biological methods (such as real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, PCR technology, multiplex PCR technology, loop-mediated isothermal amplification technology, gene chip technology, protein chip technology, etc.), instrumental analysis methods (such as mass spectrometry, flow cytometry, etc.). But they all have a same disadvantage: the inability to effectively distinguish between dead cell, viable cell and cell in a viable non-cultureable(VBNC) physiological state.



We can combine phage with molecular biological method, immunological method, luminescent reagent and sensor for different detection purposes. Thus, the characteristics of phage, such as simplicity, specificity, cheap, and ability to distinguish between living and dead cells, can be used to compensate for the shortcomings of routine testing.

The VBNC physiological state is short for viable non-culturable physiological state. When bacteria are in this state, they no longer divide, but remain in a low-activity mode until they return to a more hospitable environment, where they can grow and reproduce normally. Conventional detection methods cannot detect cell in the VBNC physiological state, because the bacteria at this time cannot produce substances that can be detected by conventional methods, resulting in a large number of false positive or false negative results. The selective specificity of phages to recognize and bind only to living cells minimizes the possibility of false positive and false negative results. By combining phage with cell culture, flow cytometry and electron microscope, cells under VBNC physiological state can be detected more conveniently and effectively.



Before starting the test, we select antibodies that can specifically recognize the target species and add magnetic tags. These antibodies have different recognition sites from the phage recognition sites, enabling both the antibody and the phage to bind to the target species at the same time.

We make special bio-chips by attaching phages to the Au substrates via lithography and micromanipulation techniques, and installing a reluctance sensor under the Au substrates. The magnetically tagged antibody is cultured with cell, and after the magnetic antibody has fully bonded with the cell, the cell in the viable and VBNC physiological state are specifically identified and captured by the phage. Magnetically tagged antibodies on the cell cause changes in the magnetic field, which are detected by a reluctance sensor at the bottom of the chip and sent out a corresponding electrical signal. Dead cell, on the other hand, are not captured by the phages and therefore cannot produce magnetic field changes. By producing different electrical signals, we can distinguish between dead cell, viable cell and cell in the VBNC state.
