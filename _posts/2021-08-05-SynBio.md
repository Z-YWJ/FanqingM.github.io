The ability to reasonably design microbes has been a long-term goal for more than a century. With the revolution of genomics and the rise of systems biology in the 1990s, since entering the 21st century, a strict engineering discipline "synthetic biology" has been  developed to create, control and program cell behavior, which has become a hot topic in the forefront of international science.

## **So what is synthetic biology?**


It's known that what kind of understanding (Science) and means (Technology) will produce what kind of engineering. In ancient times, the system of traditional Chinese medicine was established by testing plant properties through “tasting hundreds of herbs". Today, how to use the understanding of the "code" of life and the means of " compiling" it to transform nature and benefit mankind? Scientists have integrated the research concept of engineering science into modern life science, developed "convergence" research represented by synthetic biology, and contributed to the third revolution of life science. The principles of molecular biology, systems biology and engineering are combined to design biological systems and biological factories. Its goal is to create improved biological functions and solve current and future challenges.

Synthetic biology adopts the "bottom-up" concept of engineering to break the boundary between "natural" and "unnatural", from systematically characterizing biological macromolecules with catalytic regulation and other functions in nature to make them become standardized "components", to creating new biological components and cell "chassis" such as "modules" and "lines", so as to build artificial life systems with various uses. Based on the research method of "Design--Build--Test" in engineering, on the basis of learning the abstract natural life system, or "reprogram" the natural biological system, or re-design the artificial life system with new characteristics. Then, using "toolkits" such as "gene editing" and "gene synthesis", the constructed biological system is constructed by experimental methods, and then the constructed biological system is tested. In this way, it is repeatedly optimized to form a positive and reliable scientific closed loop. To deeply grasp the design principle of gene circuit and accumulate a large number of high-quality components will make the gene circuit design of synthetic biology more direct and predictable, which greatly improve the research efficiency, reprogram cells and give them new capabilities.


From the perspective of platform construction, patent and industry, safety and ethics, investment and financing and economy, science and technology policies and regulations, the synthetic biology is divided into the following research directions:
- DNA Synthesis and Assembly；
- Biomolecular Engineering；
- Design of Gene Circuits；
- Host and Community Engineering；
- Construction and Application of Synthetic Biosystems (Industry, Therapy & Medicine, Food, Agriculture, Environment, Energy, Materials)；
- Machine Learning (Data Science).



## **History and development of synthetic biology**


Synthetic biology, from the "metaphor" of synthetic science in the early 20th century to the "vision" of the breakthrough of scientific knowledge of molecular biology and DNA recombination technology, to the "naming" of modern on the basis of genome blueprint and the intervention of engineering concept, and then to the symbol of "convergence" research, has roughly experienced three stages:


The first stage, founding period (2000-2003): many research methods and theories with field characteristics have emerged, especially the establishment of gene circuit engineering and its successful application in metabolic engineering;


The second stage, expansion and development period (2004-2007): this stage is characterized by an expansion trend in the field, but the progress of engineering technology is relatively slow;


The third stage, rapid innovation and application transformation period (2008-2013): the emerging new technologies and engineering means in this stage have greatly expanded the research and application field of synthetic biology, especially the ability of synthetic genome has been raised to the level close to MB (chromosome length), and the genome editing technology has made an unprecedented breakthrough.


On this basis, in 2014, the American Academy of Sciences proposed "convergence" research as the third revolution in life science to enable the "Engineering Biology" brought by the combination of the construction of engineering platform of biotechnology and the open-source application of biomedical big data, which is comprehensively promoting the new stage of "democratization" development of biotechnology, biological industry and biomedicine, It is a solid step forward in realizing the grand goal of human "ability improvement".



## **Prospects for synthetic biology**

"Synthetic biology is a new biological research field in the early 21st century. It is based on clarifying and simulating the basic law of biosynthesis to artificially design and construct new biological systems with specific physiological functions, so as to establish biological manufacturing approaches such as drugs, functional materials or energy substitutes. China must pay attention to and strengthen the research and development in this field." Recently, at the 144th Oriental Science and technology forum with the theme of "basic frontier issues of synthetic biology", more than 60 academicians, experts and scholars from all over the country issued an appeal. At present, scientists are not limited to very hard gene splicing, but began to construct genetic codes in order to use synthetic genetic factors to construct new organisms. Synthetic biology is expected to make rapid progress in the next few years. It is estimated that synthetic biology will have excellent application prospects in many fields, including more effective vaccine production, new and improved drugs, biology based manufacturing, sustainable energy production from renewable energy, biological treatment of environmental pollution, biosensors that can detect toxic chemicals, etc.
