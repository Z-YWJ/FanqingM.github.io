Phages are well known for being obligate intracellular parasites that reproduce within the host cell and are released when the host is destroyed by lysis. Escherichia virus T4 is a lytic bacteriophage which “eats” *E. coli*. A lytic phage such as T4 leads to the death of the host when progeny phages burst (lyse) the host cell. The complete genome sequence of phage T4 contains 168,903 base pairs and encodes about 300 gene products (Miller et al., 2003). However, to now there are still nearly 130 of them remaining uncharacterized (Tao et al., 2017). Nevertheless, T4 is a most widely and best used model organism to explore the interaction between virus and bacteria. Moreover, there are many products from virus to boost the development of molecular biology, such as T4 DNA ligase and lysozymes. 



Basically, T4 is a relatively large virus, at approximately 90 nm wide and 200 nm long (most viruses range from 25 to 200 nm in length) (Miller et al., 2003). It is composed head, tail baseplate and tail fibers which all contribute to the quick infection of phage (Figure 1). The head, also known as capsid, contains DNA. The tail of T4 is hollow, which allows DNA to be injected. Moreover, the tail fibers are crucial to recognize the cellular component to attach, which determines the host range of T4 (Yap et al., 2016). The baseplate connects the tail and tail fibers. During infection, it will irreversibly bind to the cell, which causes a conformational change of tail so that the tail can penetrate further in cell membrane and inject the DNA (Yap et al., 2016).

The life cycle of T4 can be simply summarized as several sentences (Figure 2). T4 uses its tail fibers to bind to receptor sites on the surface of an *E. coli* cell. One of the first phage genes translated after the viral DNA enters the host cell codes for an enzyme that degrades the host DNA. Actually, the real infection process is far more complicated and difficult than this. First, the phage needs to attach to the cell. T4 do not randomly attach to the surface of a host cell; rather, they fasten to specific surface structures called receptor sites. The nature of these receptors varies with the phage; cell wall lipopolysaccharides and proteins, teichoic acids, flagella, and pili can serve as receptors (Miller et al., 2003). The T-even phages of *E. coli* use cell wall lipopolysaccharides or proteins as receptors. Variation in receptor properties is at least partly responsible for phage host preferences. Once the cell is infected by one phage, other phages cannot inject their genome to bacteria anymore because the injected genome will produce some protein to inhibit the infection of other phages. This is a special mechanism of T-even phage which is superinfection exclusion (Miller et al., 2003). After the DNA inject to the cytoplasm, it will utilize the host transcriptional machinery to produce the enzyme and structure protein, and the replication of genome shown in figure 3 (Kutter et al., 2018). Once the structural proteins produced, they will assemble together automatically due to the interactions between protein and protein. Also, some chaperons will engage in this process to help protein fold (Arisaka, 2005). When the genome produces a certain number of progenies, the bacteria will be lysed by the holin and lysozyme produced by phage genome (Dennehy and Abedon, 2021). The holin accumulate and form holes on membranes, which allows lysozyme come to cell wall and break the wall (Dennehy and Abedon, 2021). The damaged cell wall breaks the osmotic pressure inside cell, which causes cell lysis.
