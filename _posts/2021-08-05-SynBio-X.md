Phage research has made important contributions to the field of synthetic biology.


The first genome to be sequenced was phage Ï†X174. In 2003, the whole genome of this phage was reconstructed by Venter et al. and saved into active phage particles.


It was studying how bacteria defend against phages that led to the discovery of the CRISPR/Cas system, which won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry and is driving a major biotechnology revolution;


Phage has great potential in the development of gene elements, many phage-derived gene elements have been adapted to construct gene circuits.At the same time, phages are abundant in the biosphere, on the order of 1031, and have evolved in various ways to take over the resources of host cells to produce more phage offspring. Therefore, the study of the genetic diversity and functional diversity of phages will provide an extremely rich library of genetic elements for the study of synthetic biology. Despite this, our understanding of phages is woefully lacking. For example, the vast majority of bacteriophages in nature are poorly understood in relation to their hosts and their role in natural ecosystems. Rational design and synthesis of artificial bacteriophages by using synthetic biology methods and ideas can strengthen, change or utilize certain characteristics of bacteriophages, which is expected to help us answer some common problems in basic and applied research of bacteriophages. Phage infection efficiency can be enhanced by adding functional genes (such as antimicrobial peptides and pod depolymerase genes) to the phage genome.
Virulence protein genes and genes with unknown functions were removed as far as possible, and even chassis phage genomes were designed to achieve the purpose of highly controllable biological safety. To solve the problem of bacteriophage resistance by adding the gene element of bacteriophage resistance; Phages can carry a variety of genetic circuits, used to modify the bacterial community, knock out specific genes in the community;
Artificial modification of phage tail protein gene to replace or expand host spectrum;


The development of the strategy of transforming mild phage into vigorous phage can enrich the phage resource pool.


At the same time, phage's powerful directional evolution platform, phage display technology, phage DNA carrier and other functions are also developing vigorously.
