## General

Antibiotic-resistant superbugs are wreaking havoc on human health. Experts predict that 10 million people a year will die from superbugs by 2050 if new solutions are not proposed. Interestingly, in nature, there is **Natural Bacterial Killer: Phage!**

## **What is the phage?** 

Phages, a type of virus, rely on parasitic bacteria for survival and reproduction. E. coli is the most susceptible to phage infection, and E. coli is often used in experiments to culture and amplify viruses. The invasion of phages leads to the lysis of bacterial cells, disrupting their metabolism, and eventually causing the bacterial cells to burst and self-destruct.

Since phages can erode bacteria, what about using them to kill harmful bacteria in the body, especially those that are difficult to treat and resistant to drugs? The resulting treatment, known as phagotherapy, may is an effective way to target superbugs.



## **Phagotherapy has many advantages**

###  Bacterial host specificity

In clinical applications, the host range of bacteriophages is generally narrow. A bacteriophage is usually only effective against a specific bacterium, or a specific strain of a bacterium. This limited host range is very beneficial for disease treatment.

###  Advantages over antibiotics

Bacteria can also develop resistance to bacteriophages, but it is much simpler to develop new bacteriophages than to develop new antibiotics. It only takes a few weeks to obtain a new phage, but it takes many years to obtain a new antibiotic. When bacteria become resistant to drugs, related phages will naturally change with it. When super bacteria appeared, super phages had evolved with it. And, after lysing a specific bacterial target, the phage will stop reproducing immediately, so the phage will not develop secondary resistance similar to antibiotics.

### **Potential advantages of phage therapy**

- Each phage only attacks a very limited number of bacteria, and is almost specific to one type of bacteria. Therefore, they can target specific pathogenic bacteria without affecting the normal flora in the host;

- Phage is easy to grow and purify;

- Bacteriophages are "living drugs", their number will increase when the target bacterial population spreads, so it can be administered in small doses;

- Bacteriophages are not toxic, they only invade bacteria and not human cells;

- Self-limiting. Once the target bacterial group is eliminated, the number of phages will decrease sharply.

## Case of phage cure

On August 14, 2018, under the witness of medical staff, scientific researchers and patients, a patient with superbug infection recovered and discharged from Shanghai public health clinical center

On February 26, 2021, the international academic journal《Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology》reported a clinical trial of bacteriophage in the treatment of drug-resistant *Acinetobacter baumannii* pulmonary infection.

## The challenges of phage therapy

**The first thing to mention, of course, is the quality and safety requirements**

The success of phagotherapy depends on the safety of the phage preparation, which adds to the challenges of preparation and formulation. For a wide range of medical applications, phages need to be mass-produced in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) approved by regulators, but there are currently no clear guidelines for the preparation of phages and this requires the tireless efforts of healthcare professionals.

**The second is the stability of phage preparations**

The stability of bacteriophage preparations is a key requirement for the use of bacteriophages as drugs. Potential phage drug candidates should have a good shelf life. For example, select preparations that will not affect the activity of the phage for storage, and the titer of the phage will not decrease significantly under the condition of processing and long-term storage. Several strategies have been developed and optimized to improve the stability of bacteriophages. The most common strategies include spray drying, freeze drying, emulsion and polymerization techniques.

**In addition, how to achieve rapid screening of phages?**

Due to the high specificity of bacteriophages, it is usually necessary to screen a large number of phages to find bacteriophages against specific strains. Although a variety of methods have been developed for direct or indirect detection and quantification of phage, such as double-layer agar method, real-time quantitative PCR method, flow cytometry, surface plasmon resonance technology, etc., there are few clinical applications , And all have their limitations, further research is still needed to determine an effective method for rapid screening of phage. [**It is worth mentioning that Tongji_Software, one of the iGEM participating teams in 2021, is using computer methods to solve this problem.**](http://localhost:4000/2017-08-24-TJU/)
